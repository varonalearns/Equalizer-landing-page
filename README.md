## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project, I learned more about how background-image works. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to position a background-image and came up with the code below to position bg-main-mobile.png properly:

```css
.bg-main-image {
    background-image: url("assets/bg-main-mobile.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: ;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more. -->

### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me with understanding how background images work and how to implement them via CSS code
